    <h1>Mt. Delano</h1>

    <h4>Introduction to Mount Delano</h4>
    Mount Delano is one of the prominent peaks in the Tushar Mountains, located near Beaver, Utah. Rising to an
    elevation of approximately 12,173 feet, it stands as one of the highest peaks in the range. The mountain is named
    after Columbus Delano, a 19th-century Secretary of the Interior. Known for its alpine beauty and relatively remote
    location, Mount Delano offers breathtaking views, diverse flora and fauna, and an excellent opportunity for outdoor
    enthusiasts to explore Utah's high country. The exposed summit, however, is notorious for its strong winds, which
    can add an extra layer of challenge and exhilaration to the ascent.

    <h4>Accessing the Trailhead</h4>
    The trailhead to Mount Delano is most commonly accessed from Big John Flat, a popular camping and staging area
    located off Forest Road 123. See <a href="#other_resources">this video</a> for instructions on how to find the trailhead from Big John Flat. 
    This area is reachable by high-clearance vehicles, making it a hub for hikers, ATV
    riders, and other recreationists. From Big John Flat, adventurers embark on a journey that takes them through
    meadows filled with wildflowers, dense stands of pine and aspen, and open alpine terrain as they ascend towards the
    summit. As the trail climbs higher, hikers will notice the trees thinning out, and most of the route lies above the
    tree line, offering expansive, unobstructed views of the surrounding peaks.

    <h4>The Hiking Experience</h4>

        </div>
        <div class= "div-three">
            The hike to Mount Delano is moderate to strenuous, depending on the route and hiker experience. The most common
            trail follows a well-defined path that climbs gradually before steepening near the summit. However, hikers should be
            prepared for several “false summits” along the way, where the trail seems to crest, only to reveal more climbing
            ahead. This can test both patience and perseverance, but the promise of incredible views keeps most hikers
            motivated. Along the way, the exposed terrain allows for sweeping vistas, though it also means hikers should be
            prepared for gusty winds at almost any point on the trail.

    <h4>Wildlife and Natural Features</h4>
    Mount Delano and its surrounding areas are home to a rich variety of wildlife. Hikers often spot mule deer, marmots,
    and, occasionally, mountain goats grazing on the slopes. Bird enthusiasts may catch glimpses of golden eagles or
    Clark’s nutcrackers soaring overhead. The flora is equally captivating, with hardy alpine plants such as lupines and
    Indian paintbrush coloring the landscape during the summer months. Above the tree line, the terrain becomes rugged
    and sparse, with low-lying vegetation clinging to the rocky ground in an inspiring display of resilience.

            Standing atop Mount Delano’s summit is a rewarding experience. The panoramic views extend for miles, encompassing
            the rugged peaks of the Tushar range and the expansive valleys below.

        </div>
    </div>
    <h4>Seasonal Considerations</h4>
    Hiking Mount Delano is best undertaken in the late spring through early fall, as snow can linger well into the
    summer due to the mountain’s high elevation. During the winter months, the area transforms into a haven for
    snowmobilers and backcountry skiers. However, deep snow and unpredictable weather can make accessing the trailhead
    and climbing the peak challenging during this time. The high winds that often sweep across the summit and ridgelines
    are another factor to consider, as they can make winter ascents particularly dangerous.
    <br>
    <h4>A Destination Worth Exploring</h4>
    <div class="div-one">
        For those seeking an off-the-beaten-path adventure, Mount Delano provides an excellent blend of physical challenge
        and natural beauty. Whether approached as a day hike or part of a longer exploration of the Tushar Mountains, the
        journey to its summit is an unforgettable experience. Hikers should come prepared for the wind and the mental
        challenge of navigating false summits, but these obstacles only add to the sense of accomplishment upon reaching the
        top. The pristine environment, rugged terrain, and stunning vistas make Mount Delano a must-visit destination for
        outdoor enthusiasts in southern Utah.

    <h4>What to wear</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>Moisture-wicking shirt</li>
        <li>Lightweight fleece or down jacket for insulation</li>
        <li>Waterproof and windproof jacket</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure you plan for the wind chill. The winds can reach up to 40 mph at the peak, and without a wind-breaking layer you will be cold regardless of how many hoodies you wear.</li>
                <li>It's also important to bring lots of layers. Because of the elevation change, the temperature and conditions changes pretty drasticly along the hike and you'll want to take off and add on layers as you go.
                <li>Even in the warmest months it gets really cold on the peak, so don't be afraid to wear a pretty warm coat</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Hat</li>
    </ol>
